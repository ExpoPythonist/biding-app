# Bidding Application with Django
This application was built as a side project, in order to learn how to design and build a bidding system from scratch. The theme is based on capital raising for companies. It includes an auth system, marketplace, companies, placements, dashboard, mobile friendly design. I used Django mainly, to develop this application.
